-- Problem 6  
-- Sum square difference
-- The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is, 385.
-- The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is, 3025.
-- Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers 
-- and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.
-- Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first
-- one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
